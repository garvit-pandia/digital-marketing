DETAILS OF ACADEMIC TASK
Scenario:
The student acts as the Lead Digital Analyst for a brand of their choice (e.g., an online shoe
store, a blog, or a SaaS company). The company’s management requires a data-driven
strategy and a proof-of-concept implementation.
Part 1: The Measurement Plan (Strategy)
Select a company or brand that sells products or services online. Create a formal
Measurement Plan document that addresses the following:
1. Business Objectives & KPIs: What are the top 3 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?
(e.g., Conversion Rate, Average Order Value).
2. Segmentation Strategy: How will you segment the data to discover insights? (e.g.,
New vs. Returning Users, Mobile vs. Desktop, Traffic Source).
3. Targets: What are the specific numerical targets for your KPIs?
4. Part 2: Market Tool Evaluation (Research)
Management seeks to understand alternative options. Identify three free Web
Analytics tools (excluding standard Google Analytics) currently available in the
market.
 Provide a comparative analysis of their utility, pros, and cons.
 Recommendation: Which tool would you recommend as a secondary analytics
platform, and why?
Part 3: The Implementation (Execution)
Create a simple website for the chosen company/brand (using WordPress, Wix, Google Sites,
or HTML).
1. Setup: Integrate Google Analytics (GA4) with the live website.
2. Goals/Events: Configure specific conversion events (e.g., "Form Submission," "PDF
Download," or "Purchase").
3. Reporting: Generate a report displaying Traffic Acquisition and User Behavior.
4. Interpretation: Write a one-paragraph interpretation of the collected data.
